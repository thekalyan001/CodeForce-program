/*A. Bear and Big Brother

Examples
input
4 7
output
2
In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively
(one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet.
After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one.
Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.
